## 🎯 Project Overview

This project leverages **UDISE (Unified District Information System for Education)** data to analyze and predict student dropout rates across Indian states and union territories. By applying advanced statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and comprehensive visualization techniques, we aim to identify critical patterns and provide actionable insights for educational policymakers and administrators.

### 🔍 Dataset Characteristics

- **Geographical Coverage**: 111 States/Union Territories
- **Education Levels Analyzed**: 
  - Primary (Classes 1–5)
  - Upper Primary (Classes 6–8)
  - Secondary (Classes 9–10)
- **Feature Set**: 17 distinct features
- **Training Samples**: 88
- **Testing Samples**: 23

## 📊 Executive Summary

### Statistical Overview

Our analysis reveals critical insights into dropout patterns across different educational levels:

| Education Level | Average Dropout Rate | Trend |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Primary (1-5)** | 3.32% | 📉 Baseline |
| **Upper Primary (6-8)** | 4.37% | 📈 +31.6% increase |
| **Secondary (9-10)** | 12.82% | 📈 +286.1% increase |

### 🏆 Best Performing Model

**Linear Regression** emerged as the optimal predictive model with exceptional accuracy:

```
✓ R² Score: 0.9997 (99.97% variance explained)
✓ RMSE: 0.1271
✓ MAE: 0.0967
```

This outstanding performance indicates that dropout rates follow highly predictable linear patterns based on the selected features, enabling precise forecasting and intervention planning.

## 📐 Hypothesis Testing

### Statistical Hypotheses Validated

#### ✅ Hypothesis 1: Gender Differences
**H₀**: No significant difference in dropout rates between genders  
**H₁**: Significant gender-based differences exist

**Result**: ✓ REJECTED (p < 0.05)  
**Conclusion**: Statistically significant gender differences confirmed across all education levels

#### ✅ Hypothesis 2: Education Level Impact
**H₀**: Dropout rates are constant across education levels  
**H₁**: Dropout rates increase with education level

**Result**: ✓ REJECTED (p < 0.01)  
**Conclusion**: Strong evidence of increasing dropout rates: Secondary (12.82%) > Upper Primary (4.37%) > Primary (3.32%)

#### ✅ Hypothesis 3: Cross-Level Correlation
**H₀**: No correlation between primary and secondary dropout rates  
**H₁**: Positive correlation exists

**Result**: ✓ REJECTED (p < 0.05)
